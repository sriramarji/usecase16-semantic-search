Semantic Search over Large Documents


Scenario:
You have large text files (e.g., PDFs, logs, or articles) stored in AWS S3. You want to:
•	Parse and chunk the text
•	Generate embeddings for each chunk
•	Store them in PostgreSQL with pgvector
•	Later, perform semantic search over the content
Workflow:
1. Download File from S3
Use boto3 to fetch the file.
2. Parse and Chunk
Split the text into manageable chunks (e.g., 500 tokens each) using a tokenizer like tiktoken or nltk.
3. Generate Embeddings
Use OpenAI, Cohere, or HuggingFace to convert each chunk into a vector.
4. Store in PostgreSQL
Use pgvector to store the chunk and its embedding.




Use Case 17: Semantic Search API for Document Chunks
Scenario:
You want to expose an API endpoint where users can send a search query, and the system will:
1.	Convert the query into an embedding
2.	Search the pgvector-enabled PostgreSQL database
3.	Return the most semantically similar document chunks
Workflow
1.	User sends a POST request to API Gateway with a search query.
2.	Lambda function:
•	Converts the query to an embedding (e.g., using OpenAI or HuggingFace)
•	Queries PostgreSQL using pgvector similarity search
•	Returns top N results
